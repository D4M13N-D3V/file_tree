## üìö About

File Tree is a powerful tool designed to help you understand and manage your storage usage effectively. Use it to identify space-hogging files, find duplicate content, and gain detailed insights into the types of files on your system. It is both simple to use and highly customizable for analyzing and optimizing the storage utilization of your device.

---

## üöÄ Features (Present and Planned)

### Currently Available
- **Storage Usage by Folder View**:
    - Visualize the storage usage of each folder on your machine.
    - Interactive drill-down into subfolders to identify large files.
---

### üåü Roadmap
Below is a roadmap of future features planned for File Tree to increase its functionality and usefulness:

#### **1. Storage Usage Analysis (Enhanced Visual Stats)**
- **Visualization of Storage by Type:**
    - Charts for understanding how much space is being used by specific file types (e.g., images, videos, documents, binaries).
    - View percentage breakdown of file types across your system.
- Categories planned:
    - **Images**: PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.
    - **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.
    - **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.
    - **Binaries**: EXE, DLL, SO, and compiled files.

#### **2. Duplicate File Detection**
- **Locate Duplicate Files Across the System:**
    - Allow users to discover duplicate files based on checksums (e.g., hash comparison) or file names.
    - Intuitive interface to preview, compare, and safely delete duplicates.
    - Space-saving recommendations.

#### **3. File Type Statistics**
- **Auto-Classification of Files:**
    - Real-time calculation of percentages for each file type category.
    - Expanded file classification metrics for better insights.

#### **4. Advanced File Search**
- **Search by Attributes**:
    - Search files by size, type, creation date, or last access.
    - Advanced sorting and filtering options.

#### **5. Recommendations to Save Space**
- Smart suggestions to delete or move files that are duplicated, rarely accessed, or taking up large portions of storage without significant usage.

#### **6. Improved UI and Performance**
- Ongoing UI/UX improvements for seamless, smooth operation.
- Optimization of scanning and search algorithms for faster performance on larger file systems.
